    "When running the experiment script, each experiment type has its own \"task\" which defines the data and model to be used as well as the training schedule. Most model settings are hard-coded in configs to mirror the configurations used in the Reformer paper. All model and training hypermaramters used in training can be found in [Experiments/Configs](https://arampacha.github.io/reformer_fastai/experiment-configs.html). Depending on the task, a limited number of configs can be changed such as `seq_len` or `n_layers` for example.\n",
